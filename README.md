## Installation

The application is included in the standard firmware package of [Unleashed Firmware](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware). 
You just need to install the [latest firmware](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware/releases/latest).
<br />
You can also download the [release](https://github.com/derskythe/flipperzero-subbrute/releases/latest) and unzip/untar it to the `SD Card/apps/Sub-GHz` directory.
<br />
> [!WARNING]
> 
> The application is not compatible with the official firmware version.
> Also, it has not been tested on other firmware versions other than [Unleashed Firmware](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware) and [OFW](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware).

## User Guide

### Main Menu

Here you can select the protocol and frequency that will be used for bruteforce. 
According to our observations, `CAME 12bit 433MHz` is the most common protocol, so it is selected by default.
To identify other devices and protocols, you should inspect the device.
According to the protocol, when probe a key, each value is sent 3 times. 
Most of the devices this works but there are devices that don't work and more repetitions are needed. 
The number of repetitions can be increased with the right button, the left button decreases the value.
The negative side of increasing the number of repetitions will be a longer key find time.
